This application was developed with the help of 3 other classmates for a class project.

My main role involved the writing of many of the backend "views" or functions.
Primarily developed the backend functionality for the catalog, leveraging the Ebay API.

I also orchestrated the deployment pipeline utlizing Azure Pipelines and Amazon Web Services.
